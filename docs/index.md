# Welcome to MkDocs

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Why this Repo?

I'm providing a template to create a working mkdocs environment, optimized for usage with cloudflare pages.

I'm using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) as theme and the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) Fonts provided by Google Fonts.
The fonts are local embedded to meet german privacy laws.

Requirements (such as plugins) are tracked in  `requirements.txt`, runtime environment is specified in `runtime.txt`
